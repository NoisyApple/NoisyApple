# ðŸ˜º Hello There, I am Leonel Aguirre ðŸ˜º

I am a 22-year-old amateur web developer, currently studying Computer Systems Engineering at the Technological Institute of LeÃ³n. I am passionate about software development, as it allows me to model my ideas to achieve impressive results, my constant curiosity about how my environment works helps me to always keep learning new things. I consider myself as a person with the ability to adapt to new environments, identifying my areas of opportunity and trying to correct them.
